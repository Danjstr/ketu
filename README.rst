Turnstile
=========

An exoplanet search technique based on Gaussian processes. This only works
(but should work decently well) for long period, small planets around
not-too-variable stars :-)

Installation
------------

This code relies on `George <https://github.com/dfm/george>`_ and `Bart
<http://dan.iel.fm/bart/>`_ so make sure that you install those first. Then,
you just need to run:

::

    python setup.py install
